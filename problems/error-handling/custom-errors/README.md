# Custom Error Types and Error Wrapping Challenge

## Problem Description

You are given a payment processing system that handles various types of transactions. The current implementation has basic error handling, but it needs to be improved to provide better error context and handling. Your task is to:

1. Implement custom error types for different error scenarios
2. Add proper error wrapping with context
3. Implement error recovery mechanisms
4. Add error logging and monitoring
5. Create a robust error handling strategy

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding Go's error handling patterns
- Creating and using custom error types
- Error wrapping and context preservation
- Error recovery and logging
- Error handling best practices

## Getting Started

1. Read through the code in `main.go`
2. Identify different error scenarios
3. Implement custom error types
4. Add error wrapping
5. Verify the solution using the provided tests

## Hints

1. Consider using error interfaces
2. Think about error wrapping with context
3. Consider implementing error recovery
4. Think about error logging and monitoring

## Success Criteria

- Custom error types for different scenarios
- Proper error wrapping with context
- Graceful error recovery
- Comprehensive error logging
- Tests pass successfully

## Bonus Challenge

1. Implement error metrics collection
2. Add error reporting to external services
3. Create an error dashboard
4. Implement error retry mechanisms
