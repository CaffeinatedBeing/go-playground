# Performance Benchmarking Challenge

## Problem Description

You are given a set of string processing functions with different implementations. Your task is to:

1. Write comprehensive benchmarks for each implementation
2. Compare their performance characteristics
3. Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. Document your findings and recommendations

## Learning Objectives

- Writing effective Go benchmarks
- Using different benchmarking techniques
- Profiling Go code
- Analyzing benchmark results
- Understanding performance characteristics
- Memory allocation analysis

## Getting Started

1. Read the code in `main.go` which contains different string processing implementations
2. Write benchmarks for each implementation in `main_test.go`
3. Run the benchmarks and analyze the results
4. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
5. Document your findings and suggest optimizations

## Benchmarking Techniques to Implement

1. Basic benchmarking with different input sizes
2. Memory allocation benchmarking
3. Sub-benchmarks for different scenarios
4. Parallel benchmarking
5. Custom benchmark metrics
6. CPU and memory profiling

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive benchmark suite covering all implementations
- Clear documentation of performance characteristics
- Identification of bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Proper use of Go's benchmarking tools
- Meaningful benchmark results and analysis

## Bonus Challenge

- Implement custom benchmark metrics
- Create a benchmark comparison report
